## Overview
Create a secure, concise, efficient API based on Firebase serverless function such that the Flutterflow app can log to Google Logs.

## Context
The Flutterflow app is already integrated with Firebase.  We should take advantage of this.

## Features
The API will take useful context to create a meaningful log line in Google.  It should be based on best practice of logging in Google.

The design should leverage the flutterflow builder app to get useful context.
