# Context

You will be given a GitHub ticket that has been created by a local agent.

# What does the Remote Agent work on?
The remote agent should have a specific branch.

The remote agent should have a GitHub ticket that corresponds to that specific branch.

The name of the ticket should have the branch name.

The branch name should ideally also contain the ticket name.

The GitHub ticket should reference important context:

1. Systems Diagram
2. Design documents for architecture
4. Tasks and sub tasks needed
5. Context files by URL that should be in the branch (likely in a `docs` folder
6. Context to the `aiDocs` which may contain additional prompts for you to execute
